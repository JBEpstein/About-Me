          <p class="no-tandb-margin">I went to La Sierra military academy, while I was in military high school I took as much graphic design and computer base electives as I could. Back then html was much simpler and I could build basic websites. While I was in high school I took college classes at a community college and ended up graduating as valedictorian.</p>

          <p class="no-tandb-margin">After high school, I went back to the same community college I was going to during high school... Sadly it was not for me due to my maturity level at the time. I worked at a place called Adventure Park in CA for about a year. While at Adventure Park I fixed arcade games, batting cages, and laser tag vests/guns.</p>

          <p class="no-tandb-margin">Working at Advernture Park was not enough for me and was not going to go anywhere. I enlisted in the Air Force at the age of 19 and ended up as a 2W1, also known as Armament Systems Specialist. I did a few different things while in the Air Force including Honorguard and getting augmented into Security Forces. I went into a program called palace chase that moved me from active duty into the reserves after 6.4 years of activer duty and I ended up stationed at JBLM.</p>

           <p class="no-tandb-margin">After ending up in WA, I was lucky enough to end up with an IT job. I started as a jr. Network Support Engineer and am currently a Network Support Engineer for National products inc.. They are also known as Rammount, you can see what they do at rammount.com. I built a lot of the servers they are running on and help keep their everyday IT needs taken care of. I hope to use Code Fellows as a way to progress my career into Development.</p>
